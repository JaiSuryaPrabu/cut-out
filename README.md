# Cut Out
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12+-blue.svg)

Cut out is a image segmentation implementation project that allows users to upload an image, select a region of interest and generate a cutout image with the selected region. In this project, I used Meta's [Segment Anything Model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/tree/main) which is state of the art deep learning model in the image segmentation task. To try the demo visit [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JaiSurya/cut-out). To try the Meta's demo try [here](https://segment-anything.com/demo).
